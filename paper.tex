\begin{abstract}

When wading through the numerous libraries written by
the Haskell community, one sometimes gets the impression that the type
system is being too much relied on, at the expense of testing.
While the type system cannot always guarantee semantic correctness,
test code has more applications than getting the code correct.
Test code assists developers in maintaining correctness when extending
software, and shows users how an API is supposed to be used.
To ease the production and enhance the value of test code, we advocate
behavior driven development with two tools:
QuickCheck integrated in Doctest for user documentation and Hspec
with new mnemonic combinators for code documentation.
Our method utilizes specification that can also be used for
documentation and automated testing. We hope that this three-in-one
quality motivates Haskellers to write more test code.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

%%%% Describe the problem.

Haskell~\cite{haskell} has a strong type system, which ensures that most type errors are
detected at compile time rather than runtime.  Thanks to this, we assume that
programs written in Haskell have less bugs than programs written in programming
languages that do not provide such a strong type system.

Unfortunately, the type system of Haskell does not always guarantee
correct semantics.
For example, it does not ensure that division by zero does not occur.
An other example is, that instances of {\tt Monoid} \emph{should} be
monoids in the mathematical sense, but the type system does not
enforce this.  It is the programmers responsibility to ensure that
instance definitions \emph{behave} as \emph{expected}.  Hence
automated testing is useful.

However, some widely used Haskell libraries do not have automated
tests.  For example, the Haskell Platform 2011.4.0.0 contains 23
packages, not counting the 19 core libraries that come with GHC.  Only
8 of them have a test suite, 5 provide example code, and 10 have
neither tests nor examples.  A lack of tests is not only a quality and
maintainability issue.  It also is a lack of documentation.  Tests
document how code is supposed to be used, and tests document the
behavior of code.

In other programming language communities, behavior driven development
(BDD) is getting much attention, and is slowly replacing test driven
development (TDD).  TDD is an iterative style of software development
where the developer first writes a few test cases, then implements the
software in the simplest possible way which makes the test cases pass.
That could mean yielding a constant value at first.  Subsequently,
more test cases are written to require more details and drive the
implementation closer to the desired goal.  Rinse and repeat.

BDD includes TDD, amongst other software development methodologies,
but with a terminology and mindset shifted towards
specification instead of testing.
In BDD, specifications can be used for
automated testing.
BDD is meant to be an enjoyable experience for the developer.
Compared to TDD it provides a much nicer syntax that
makes tests very easy to read.  And like TDD it puts emphasis on
test automation, to take workload off the shoulders of
developers.
BDD-style TDD has been pioneered by
RSpec~\cite{rspec}.  In this paper, we explore how to apply the TDD
aspect of BDD to Haskell.


In BDD, all behavior should be documented, together with some testable
\emph{evidence} for that behavior.  Most existing BDD tools only use
\emph{code examples} as evidence for behavior.
Hspec\footnote{%
http://hackage.haskell.org/package/hspec},
a BDD tool for Haskell inspired by RSpec, supports
both code examples and \emph{properties} as evidence.
It can verify examples and test properties, and it can create an
informal specification document from that.

Hspec is thus useful for \emph{code documentation}, but we observed that parts
of a specification can be useful as user documentation. To that end,
Python's {\tt doctest} module~\cite{doctest} is of interest for us.
It is not commonly described as a BDD tool, but we think it can be
used for BDD.
There is a Haskell version called Doctest\footnote{%
http://hackage.haskell.org/package/doctest}, which is integrated with Haddock~\cite{haddock},
the standard documentation mechanism for Haskell.
It extracts \emph{interactive examples} from Haddock comments and
verifies them automatically.

We show how to use Doctest and Hspec in combination, to design,
document and test Haskell code.  Both, Doctest and Hspec are missing
some features.  So we extend them as needed.  In particular, our
contributions are:

\begin{itemize}
\item
    We originally implemented Haskell's version of Doctest, and
    extended Haddock's markup to support examples, back in 2010
\item
    We added support for QuickCheck properties to Doctest, and extended
    Haddock's markup to support properties
    (Section
    \ref{sec:user-doc} and Section \ref{sec:doctest})

\item
    We introduce a set of combinators to express expectations about
    code examples for use with Hspec (Section \ref{sec:code-doc} and
    Section \ref{sec:hspec-comb})

\item
    We improve CI support for Doctest and Hspec (Section
    \ref{sec:TBD})

    TBD:
    \emph{This relates to hspec-discover and Doctest's Cabal support.}

\item
    We show best current practices of BDD in Haskell, using Doctest
    and Hspec (Section \ref{ref:Best-current-practice})

\end{itemize}

\noindent Our approach can be used for design, documentation and
automated testing.  We hope that this motivates Haskellers to write
more and better tests.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Terminology}

The definitions of words used in this paper is as follows:

\begin{description}

\item[example]
    An example shows how a function is used.  It is either a \emph{code
    example} in the form of an HUnit test case; or an \emph{interactive
    example}, given as a short GHCi session.

\item[expectation]
    Expectations are used to define the expected outcome of a code
    example.  They serve the same purpose as \emph{assertions} in xUnit
    testing frameworks, but use a different terminology.

\item[property]
    Property means a QuickCheck property as defined in
    \cite{quickcheck}.

\item[behavior]
    Behavior means an invariant of a function.  We use an informal description
    to refer to a particular behavior, e.g.  "sorts a list" or "launches
    missiles when run".

\item[evidence]
    Evidence provides some confidence, that a function exhibits a
    certain behavior.  In Haskell we use examples and properties as
    evidence.

\item[spec]
    TBD: BDD terminology for test suite.
\end{description}


\begin{quote}
    \emph{sol: Can we remove what follows?}

    \emph{kazu: I want to keep them for readability.}

    \emph{sol: For me it really depends on how often we use something.
    If we only use it once or twice, I'd try make it clear from the
    context what is meant.}
\end{quote}

\begin{description}
\item[developer]
    A programmer who develops a library.

\item[user]
    A programmer who uses a library.


\item[user documentation]
    Explanation of functions for users.
\item[code documentation]
    Explanation of functions for developers.

\item[non-quantified property]
    Property which does not take parameters.

\item[quantified property]
    Property which takes parameters.

\end{description}

The word ``behavior'' is associated with imperative actions.  Since
pure functions of Haskell are static, this word might be improper for
Haskell.  However, this word is already used in the Haskell
community~\cite{typeclassopedia}.  So, we use ``behavior'' instead of
defining terminology in this paper.

\begin{quote}
    sol: We e.g. say ill-behaved Monoid instance.  So is
    ``behavior'' really a ``bad'' word?  But I agree that some people in
    the community might associated it with something imperative.

    kazu: ``behavior'' sounded strange at least to me at the first time.
    We alreay supported this word with typeclassopedia. So, I think
    this paragraph is completed. Should we replace ``is associated'' with
    ``might be associated''?

    sol: @kazu, this was primarily meant for @mkl as reference.

    One might also argue that ``should'' is not very mathematical, but
    it is common language when we talk about mathematics.  E.g. Brent
    Yorgey uses both ``should'' and ``behave'' a lot in the
    Typeclassopedia (e.g. ``\ldots {\tt Alternative} should satisfy
    the monoid laws\ldots'')
\end{quote}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Problem}
\label{sec:problem}

BDD tools can be used to document the behavior of a system in a way that
is similar to a specification.  All facets of the system should be
described with evidence, including every possible corner case.

As we discussed in Section~\ref{sec:introduction},
We think that some evidence is useful as user documentation.
But there is also evidence, that is not
useful as user documentation.  E.g. that a particular \texttt{Monoid}
instance is a monoid in the mathematical sense is self-evident.

We propose to use Doctest and Haddock for evidence that is useful as
user documentation, and Hspec for evidence that is not useful as user
documentation.  The following subsections discuss problems that we
have to solve before we can do this.

\subsection{Doctest and Haddock}
\label{sec:doctest-haddock}

Haddock has markup support for code blocks, and they are widely used
to include properties and examples into documentation\footnote{
See e.g. the documentation of
{\tt containers},
{\tt filepath},
{\tt bytestring} or
{\tt text}}.
Here is an example from the {\tt filepath} package.

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
-- | Does the given filename have an extension?
--
-- > null (takeExtension x) == not (hasExtension x)
hasExtension :: FilePath -> Bool
hasExtension = any isExtSeparator . takeFileName
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}

\noindent Though code blocks in Haddock comments are a useful feature,
we still think that this particular usage has problems.  The code
block contains a property.  And it would be useful to have a tool that
automatically extracts and tests the property.
But writing such a tool is hard, because it is not easy to decide
whether the code block is a property, an example, or something else.

So, we need common syntax to describe examples and properties
independently in Haddock. Doctest should automatically verify
examples and test properties.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Hspec}

If we have evidence that does not fit into the user documentation, but
would rather be part of a design document, we use Hspec\footnote{%
Hspec was originally implemented by Trystan Spangler, and is now
maintained by one of the authors.}.

Hspec provides an EDSL for defining specs.  A spec organizes evidence
in a tree structure (or a forest, to be accurate), and it is defined
with \texttt{it} and \texttt{describe}.

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
import Test.Hspec.Monadic

main :: IO ()
main = hspec spec

spec :: Spec
spec = do
  describe "reverse" $ do
    it "reverses a list" $
      assertEqual "" [3, 2, 1] (reverse [1, 2, 3])

    it "gives the original list, if applied twice" $
      property $ \xs ->
        (reverse . reverse) xs == (xs :: [Int])
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}

\noindent The {\tt it} function combines a text description for a
behavior and some evidence (a code example or a property) into a spec.
Code examples can be arbitrary HUnit assertions.  Properties must be of type {\tt
Property}; QuickCheck's \texttt{property} function can be used to turn
arbitrary properties into a \texttt{Property}.

The \texttt{describe} function combines a list of specs into a larger spec.
% It can be used to organize a spec as a tree.
% Internally, a \texttt{Writer} is used to build up specs in a monadic way.
A spec can be run with the \texttt{hspec} function.  When a spec is
run, all evidence is tested.  Behavior with evidence that does not
hold is reported to the developer.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% \subsubsection{Hspec does not provide a mechanism for expectations}
BDD frameworks use \emph{should} or \emph{must} instead of
\emph{assert} to express expectations.  Here is an example that uses
RSpec.

\begin{quote}\small\begin{verbatim}
[1, 2, 3].reverse.should eq([3, 2, 1])
\end{verbatim}\end{quote}


\noindent Hspec does not yet provide a mechanism to express
\emph{expectations} with that terminology.  The developer has to use
HUnit assertions instead.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% \subsubsection{Hspec provides no mechanism to expect exceptions}
Moreover RSpec provides a mechanism to expect exceptions.

\begin{quote}\small\begin{verbatim}
expect {launch_missiles}.to raise_error
\end{verbatim}\end{quote}

\noindent Neither Hspec nor HUnit provide a convenient equivalent.

\subsection{Automatic discovery of specs}
\label{sec:problem-discovery}

\begin{quote}
    TBD: introduce \emph{test driver}
\end{quote}

It is a common convention to have one spec file for each source file.
To run all specs for a given project together, it is necessary to
combine all the specs from all spec files into a single spec.  For
example, if we have three modules, \verb|Foo|, \verb|Foo.Bar| and
\verb|Baz|, and corresponding specs in \verb|FooSpec|,
\verb|Foo.BarSpec| and \verb|BazSpec|, we are required to write the
following boilerplate:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
import Test.Hspec.Monadic

import qualified FooSpec
import qualified Foo.BarSpec
import qualified BazSpec

main :: IO ()
main = hspec $ do
  describe "Foo"     FooSpec.spec
  describe "Foo.Bar" Foo.BarSpec.spec
  describe "Baz"     BazSpec.spec
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}

\noindent This is neither challenging nor interesting, so it should be
automated.  But Hspec does not provide a solution for that.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Problem summary}

Here is a summary of the problem:

\begin{itemize}
\item
    For user documentation,
    Haddock does not have markup to describe evidence.
\item
    For code documentation,
    Hspec does not provide combinators to express expectations with
    BDD terminology.
\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Solution}

As we explained in Section \ref{sec:problem},
we use Doctest for user documentation and Hspec for code documentation.
The following subsections explain two extensions to Haddock's markup.
And combinators for expectations, that can be used with Hspec, are
introduced.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{User documentation}
\label{sec:user-doc}



Evidence that is useful as user documentation should be included in
Haddock comments.  For this purpose, we propose the following:

\begin{itemize}
\item Add markup syntax for interactive examples to Haddock
\item Add markup syntax for properties to Haddock
\item Bring Doctest from the Python community to the Haskell
community and integrate it with QuickCheck.
Examples and properties in Haddock comments is automatically
tested by the Doctest command.
Its implementation will be discussed in Section~\ref{sec:doctest}.

\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Markup for examples}

\begin{quote}
\begin{itemize}
    \item
        We already added markup support for interactive examples to
        Haddock, back in 2010; and Doctest can verify them.
    \item
        But it is not possible to use properties in Haddock comments
        and automatically test them.

    \emph{kazu: I guess that it's enough to describe this in the Implementation Section.}
\end{itemize}
\end{quote}

\noindent First, we introduce new Haddock markup for interactive examples.
In this paper, we use {\tt >>>} which is the same as Python's one.
Here is an example:


\begin{quote}
    sol: @kazu should we make the Haddock examples in this section
    valid Haddock comments?
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
-- |
-- >>> length []
-- 0
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}

\noindent The first line starts with {\tt >>>} and an expression follows. The second line contains its result. We can write this by copy-and-pasting from an interpreter and modifying the prompt.
It's worth explaining that we can specify operation sequences:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
>>> writeFile "tmpfile" "Hello"
>>> readFile "tmpfile"
"Hello"
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}

\noindent Also, we can show exceptions.

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
>>> head []
*** Exception: Prelude.head: empty list
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Markup for properties}
\label{sec:markup}

\noindent To specify properties, we also propose new markup. In this paper, we
use the {\tt prop>} prefix. We can write non-quantified properties as follows:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
prop> Data.Map.null empty == True
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}

\noindent And it is possible to quantify properties by using a
lambda expression. The property from Section~\ref{sec:doctest-haddock}
can be written as:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{alltt}
prop> \verb|\|x -> null (takeExtension x) == \(\hookleftarrow\)
            not (hasExtension x)
\end{alltt}
\end{quote}

\noindent Note that the $\hookleftarrow$ symbol denotes line
continuation.
If a default type is not suitable, expression type-signatures can be
specified for each parameter:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
prop> \xs -> sort xs == (sort . sort) (xs :: [Int])
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}

\noindent Since the right hand side of {\tt ->} is verbose as documentation,
lambda terms without the lambda prefix are also allowed:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
prop> sort xs == (sort . sort) (xs :: [Int])
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}

\noindent We call such properties \emph{implicitly quantified}.  The
given property is implicitly quantified over \verb|xs|.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Code documentation}
\label{sec:code-doc}

We propose the following extensions for Hspec to
describe evidence for developers.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Setting expectations}

We propose several combinators which can be used to set expectations
about the outcome of code examples.  These are built on top of HUnit:

\begin{quote}\small\begin{verbatim}
type Expectation = Assertion
\end{verbatim}\end{quote}

\noindent A common expectation is, that a value should be equal to an other
value:

\begin{quote}\small\begin{verbatim}
x `shouldBe` 23
\end{verbatim}\end{quote}

\noindent This is just an other name for HUnit's \texttt{@?=}
operator.  The type is:

\begin{quote}\small\begin{verbatim}
shouldBe :: (Show a, Eq a) => a -> a -> Expectation
\end{verbatim}\end{quote}

\noindent Or we may expect that a value should satisfies some
predicate.

\begin{quote}\small\begin{verbatim}
x `shouldSatisfy` (< 23)
\end{verbatim}\end{quote}

\noindent The value is required to be in the \texttt{Show} class, so that a
useful error message can be given when the predicate is not satisfied.

\begin{quote}\small\begin{verbatim}
shouldSatisfy :: Show a => a -> (a -> Bool)
  -> Expectation
\end{verbatim}\end{quote}

\noindent Code examples are often used to provide evidence for {\tt
IO} actions, e.g.:

\begin{quote}\small\begin{verbatim}
launchMissiles >>=
  (`shouldBe` Left "not implemented")
\end{verbatim}\end{quote}

\noindent So we propose a shortcut for this common use case:

\begin{quote}\small\begin{verbatim}
launchMissiles `shouldReturn` Left "not implemented"
\end{verbatim}\end{quote}

\noindent Where \verb|shouldReturn| has the following type:

\begin{quote}\small\begin{verbatim}
shouldReturn :: (Show a, Eq a) => IO a -> a
  -> Expectation
\end{verbatim}\end{quote}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Expecting exceptions}

HUnit does not provide any versatile mechanism to state that an action
should throw an exception.  So we propose a combinator for that.

\begin{quote}\small\begin{verbatim}
shouldThrow :: Exception e => IO a -> (e -> Bool)
  -> Expectation
\end{verbatim}\end{quote}

\noindent It takes an {\tt IO} action, and a predicate.  The predicate
servers two purposes.  It selects the type of the expected exception,
and constraints the value.  Here is an example:

\begin{quote}\small\begin{verbatim}
launchMissiles `shouldThrow` (== ExitFailure 1)
\end{verbatim}\end{quote}

\noindent And it can be used with predicates from {\tt
System.IO.Error}, to require specific {\tt IOException}, e.g.  with
{\tt isPermissionError}:

\begin{quote}\small\begin{verbatim}
launchMissiles `shouldThrow` isPermissionError
\end{verbatim}\end{quote}

\noindent To make it more convenient to expect any exception of a
certain type, we provide type-restricted versions of {\tt (const
True)} for all standard exceptions, e.g.:

\begin{quote}\small\begin{verbatim}
anyArithException :: ArithException -> Bool
anyArithException = const True
\end{verbatim}\end{quote}

\noindent Which can be used like so:

\begin{quote}\small\begin{verbatim}
evaluate (1 `div` 0) `shouldThrow` anyArithException
\end{verbatim}\end{quote}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Automatic discovery of specs}
\label{sec:solution-discovery}
We want to automatically discover all specs of a project, so that we
can run them all together.  This requires to automatically generate
boilerplate code, similar to what is shown in
\ref{sec:problem-discovery}.

We make creative use GHC's support for custom preprocessors for
that.  With our solution, the developer creates a test driver, that only
contains a single line:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
{-# OPTIONS_GHC -F -pgmF hspec-discover #-}
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}

\noindent This tells GHC to run a preprocessor, \verb|hspec-discover|, on the
source file.  \verb|hspec-discover| finds all specs for a project, and
generates a suitable test driver.

This approach relies on the following conventions:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item
        Spec files have to be placed into the same directory as the
        test driver, or into a subdirectory.
    \item
        The name of a spec file has to end in \verb|Spec.hs|, and the
        module name has to match the file name.
    \item
        Each spec file has to export a top-level binding \verb|spec|,
        of type \verb|Spec|.
\end{enumerate}

\noindent It would be possible to lift some of those requirements.
But we think they are reasonable conventions, anyway.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Implementation}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Haddock}

\begin{quote}
    TBD: This section needs more work, to get the wording right.
\end{quote}

Haddock version 2.7.2 and earlier provided markup syntax for
code blocks, but did not provide any markup syntax for evidence.
As we described, we implemented markup support for interactive examples ({\tt >>>}) in 2010.
It is available in Haddock version 2.8 or later.
We also extended Haddock to support markup for properties ({\tt prop>}) which
will be available with a future release of Haddock.
Both interactive examples and properties in Haddock comments are
include into generated documentation.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% \subsection{QuickCheck}

%% \emph{TBD What does this have to do with the topic of the paper?}
%% \emph{Acknowledgment is enough.}

%% It is enough to test non-quantified properties just one.
%% However, QuickCheck 2.3 or earlier tests
%% non-quantified properties 100 times.
%% More precisely, the evaluation results are memorized and they are
%% compared with {\tt True} 100 times.
%% The current maintainer of QuickCheck modified so that
%% non-quantified properties
%% are tested just once in its source repository.
%% This feature will be available in the future release.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Doctest}
\label{sec:doctest}

To extract evidence from Haddock comments,
Doctest used the Haddock API in the past.
Since each release of Haddock supports only the latest version of GHC,
it is difficult to support old versions of GHC with Haddock API.
Doctest is now directly using GHC API for portability.

\subsubsection{Testing examples}

To verify examples, Doctest uses GHCi.
Test is done by comparing result string in Haddock notation and
result string from GHCi.
Since verification based on string comparison, exceptions can be handled.

Doctest reuses the same GHCi session for all examples.
Examples from the same Haddock comment are grouped together,
and share the same scope.
The scope is cleared with \verb|:reload| before a new
example group is started.

\subsubsection{Testing properties}

\noindent QuickCheck and GHCi are used to test properties.  Before we
test a property, we bring the module that contains the Haddock comment
from which we extracted the property into scope.

Implicitly quantified properties need to be closed before they can be
tested.  This requires the following steps.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item
        Find all free variables of the property
    \item
        Try to lookup each free variable in the module context
    \item
        Close the property over all free variables, for which lookup
        failed
\end{enumerate}

\noindent Here is the example from Section~\ref{sec:markup}:

\begin{quote}\small\begin{verbatim}
sort xs == (sort . sort) (xs :: [Int]))
\end{verbatim}\end{quote}

\noindent Both \verb|xs| and \verb|sort| are free variables, but
\verb|sort| is bound by the module context.  So we need to close the
term over \verb|xs|.

\begin{quote}\small\begin{verbatim}
\xs -> sort xs == (sort . sort) (xs :: [Int])
\end{verbatim}\end{quote}

The implementation is fully functional, and it will be included in the
next release of Doctest.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{Hspec combinators for expectations}
\label{sec:hspec-comb}

\noindent All combinators introduced in \ref{sec:code-doc} have been
implemented.  They are available form Hackage\footnote{%
http://hackage.haskell.org/package/hspec-shouldbe},
and they will be incorporated into a future
release of Hspec.
The implementation is straightforward, so we will not further discuss
it.

\begin{quote}
    TBD: The implementation of \verb|shouldThrow| may still be
    interesting.  We can describe it, if we have time left.
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
shouldThrow ::
  Exception e => IO a -> Selector e -> Assertion
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}

\subsection{hspec-discover}
\label{sec:implementation-discovery}

As discussed in \ref{sec:solution-discovery}, we use a preprocessor to
automatically generate test drivers for Hspec.  GHC invokes the
preprocessor with three arguments:

\begin{description}
    \item[{\tt src}]
        -- path to the original source file\\
        A preprocessor usually does not
        look at the content of this file.  It is only provided, so
        that it can be used in error messages.
    \item[{\tt cur}]
        -- path to a file that holds the input for the preprocessor
    \item[{\tt dst}]
        -- a path, where the preprocessor should write it's result to
\end{description}


\noindent A typical preprocessor reads the content of {\tt cur},
processes it, and writes the result to {\tt dst}.  If something goes
wrong, it uses {\tt src} in error messages to refer to the source
file.

\verb|hspec-discover| ignores {\tt cur} altogether.  It uses the
directory component of {\tt src}, to find all files that are in the
same directory as the source file, or in any subdirectories.  It then generates
a test driver from all files that end in {\tt Spec.hs}.

A fully functional implementations is available from
Hackage\footnote{http://hackage.haskell.org/package/hspec-discover},
and it will be incorporate into a future release of Hspec.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Best current practices}
\label{ref:Best-current-practice}

This section show best current practices of
BDD in Haskell.

\subsection{Procedure of BDD}

First, we write a signature and leave the definition of the function undefined.

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
reverse :: [a] -> [a]
reverse = undefined
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}

\noindent Note that the {\tt placeholders} library provides better
keywords such as {\tt notImplemented} and {\tt todo}, which tells
source locations when executed.
\begin{quote}
    sol: @kazu Would it be fine with you to remove the reference to
    placeholders?

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Do we need it to make our point?
        \item It requires template-haskell and additional import, and
            is thus not very practical.
    \end{itemize}
\end{quote}

Next we write user documentation in Haddock markup:


\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{alltt}
-- |
-- 'reverse' @xs@ returns the elements of @xs@
-- in reverse order. @xs@ must be finite.
--
-- >>> reverse [1,2,3]
-- [3,2,1]
--
-- prop> reverse [] == reverse []
-- prop> reverse (xs ++ ys) == reverse ys ++ \(\hookleftarrow\)
                               reverse (xs::[Int])
-- prop> reverse (reverse xs) == (xs::[Int])

reverse :: [a] -> [a]
reverse = undefined
\end{alltt}
\end{quote}

\noindent We should execute Doctest to ensure no syntax errors.
Also, we write code documentation with Hspec:

\begin{quote}
    sol: TBD. @kazu, the descriptions make no sense, can you try to
    make them more precise?
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
describe "reverse" $ do
  it "returns the first element in the last" $
    property $ \xs -> not (null xs) ==>
      head (reverse xs) == last (xs :: [Int])

  it "returns the last element in the first" $
    property $ \xs -> not (null xs) ==>
      last (reverse xs) == head (xs :: [Int])
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}

\noindent Also, we should execute this Hspec module
to ensure no syntax errors.
Then we implement the function.

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
reverse :: [a] -> [a]
reverse = foldl (flip (:)) []
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}

\noindent Now we run tests, and improve our implementation, until all
tests pass.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Integrating multiple test suites}

\begin{quote}
    TBD

\begin{itemize}

\item It is important that testing is automated, including running of test
    suites.  Where should we put this?

\item automatically sounds strange, better use automated somehow
\end{itemize}
\end{quote}

\noindent Cabal's test feature can be used to automatically run tests~\cite{cabal}.  A cabal
file can contain multiple test suites, so it is possible to define test suites
for Doctest and Hspec in the same cabal file.

As discussed in \ref{sec:solution-discovery}, we can use {\tt
hspec-discover} to automatically generate a test driver for Hspec:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
-- file Spec.hs
{-# OPTIONS_GHC -F -pgmF hspec-discover #-}
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}

\noindent A corresponding Cabal test suite section looks like this:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
test-suite spec
  type:          exitcode-stdio-1.0
  main-is:       Spec.hs
  build-depends: base, hspec
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}

\noindent A driver for Doctest looks like so:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
-- file doctests.hs
import Test.DocTest
main = doctest ["src/Main.hs"]
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}

\noindent And a corresponding Cabal test suite section like so:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
test-suite doctests
  type:          exitcode-stdio-1.0
  main-is:       doctests.hs
  build-depends: base, doctest
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Open problems and future work}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Reusable spec}

Reusable spec is an idea to scrap boilerplate of evidence.
For instance, without reusable spec,
each developer of an instance of a type class should
express evidence for its laws.
Since instances of a type class share API,
we can avoid such boilerplate.
The following is an example to implement
evidence for Monoid laws:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
shouldSatisfyMonoidLaws ::
  (Eq a, Show a, Monoid a, Arbitrary a) => a -> Specs
shouldSatisfyMonoidLaws t = do
  describe "mempty" $ do
    it "is a left identity" $ property $ \x ->
      mempty <> x == x `asTypeOf` t

    it "is a right identity" $ property $ \x ->
      x <> mempty == x `asTypeOf` t

  describe "<>" $ do
    it "is associative" $ property $ \x y z ->
      (x <> y) <> z == x <> (y <> z) `asTypeOf` t
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}

\noindent This can be used to document and automatically test
arbitrary Monoid instances.
Here is an example how to use it for lists:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
describe "List as a Monoid" $
  shouldSatisfyMonoidLaws (undefined :: [Int])
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}

\noindent We have already implemented this experimentally.
We should ensure the practicality of reusable spec and
prepare reusable spec to cover variety of type classes.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Source locations for failing examples}

TBD:

We do not get source locations for failing tests. Doctest solves this.
Something like JHC's
\verb|SRCLOC_ANNOTATE|
pragma\footnote{%
http://repetae.net/computer/jhc/jhc.shtml} could help
for Hspec/QuickCheck/HUnit.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{TBD}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \emph{optional}: Bridging the gap between HUnit and QuickCheck
    \item
        Feedback for failing QuickCheck properties is not always as
        useful as it could be -> combinators that use QuickCheck's
        Result type could help
    \item
        Are more high-lever approaches to BDD, akin to Ruby's
        Cucumber, applicable to Haskell? (Observation: Cucumber's
        approach is tightly tied to OO)
\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Related work}

SmallCheck~\cite{smallcheck} is a tool for
automatic exhaustive testing at a certain level.
Both Doctest and Hspec do not have support for SmallCheck
at this moment.
Hspec's mechanism for evidence is extensible.
If necessary, it would be easy to support SmallCheck.

The {\tt test-framework} family is a TDD tool,
which currently integrates HUnit, QuickCheck, SmallCheck, and Doctest.
Automatic test discovery based on prefixes of function name
and is implemented using Template Haskell~\cite{template-haskell}.
All examples and properties must be written in a single
source file.

\begin{quote}
    sol: I think you can have several files with tests, but you have
    to combine the test suites manually.
\end{quote}

The {\tt testpack} package provides a function to check
exception, similar to {\tt shouldThrow} described in Section~\ref{todo}.

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
assertRaises :: (Show a, Exception e, Show e, Eq e) =>
  String -> e -> IO a -> IO ()
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}

\noindent But it has several shortcomings:
It only works for exceptions with an {\tt Eq} instance,
but several standard exceptions (most
prominently {\tt ErrorCall}) have no {\tt Eq} instance.
And it places an unnecessary {\tt Show} constraint on the
result of the {\tt IO} action, further limiting it's applicability.
It only allows to expect specific values, expecting
any exception of a certain type is not possible.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Conclusion}

TBD:

\begin{itemize}
\item
    We discussed how to apply BDD to Haskell.
\item
    We proposed to use Doctest for user documentation and Hspec for
    code documentation.
\item
    We added markup support for properties and examples to Haddock.
    And we implemented Doctest, to verify examples and test properties
    from Haddock comments.
\item
    We extend Hspec with a set of combinators for expectations.
\item
    With these two tools, specification can also be used for
    documentation and automatic testing.
\item
    We describe a mechanism, that can automatically discover all specs
    of a project.
\item
    We think that this enhances the value of test code, and we hope
    that it will motivate Haskell programmers to write more and better
    tests.
\end{itemize}

\acks

We are grateful to David Waern, Haddock's maintainer for reviewing and
accepting our patches to Haddock.
We would like to thank
Nick Smallbone for having improved QuickCheck so that
non-quantified properties are tested just once.
