\section{Introduction}

%%%% Describe the problem.

Haskell has a very strong type system, which ensures that most type errors are
detected at compile time rather than runtime.  Thanks to this, we assume that
programs written in Haskell have less bugs than programs written in programming
languages that do not provide such a strong type system.

Unfortunately, the strong type system of Haskell does not guarantee correct
semantic.

\begin{quote}
    \emph{TBD: What about dependent types and GHC's new features?}
\end{quote}

Haskell programmers, however, tend to rely on the type system too much.  They
tend to write less test code than programmers of other programming languages.

\begin{quote}
    \emph{we need evidence to support this.}
\end{quote}

This also means that typical usage examples are not provided by test code.

We agree that type signatures are good abstract documentation~\cite{free}, but
there are many functions whose behavior cannot be guessed from their names and
type signatures.  One example is \verb|nub :: [a] -> [a]| from {\tt Data.List}.

In other programming language communities,
behavior driven development (BDD) is getting much attention, and is
slowly replacing test driven development (TDD).
In BDD, test code is written with specification terminology.
In other words, specifications can be used for automatic testing.

In this paper, we explore how to apply BDD to Haskell.
We brought a test method from other programming language community and
integrated it with a Haskell-original test method.
In particular, we introduced \doctest{}~\cite{doctest} and
integrated it with QuickCheck~\cite{quickcheck} as a BDD tool.
We also make use of \hspec{} inspired by RSpec~\cite{rspec} for
BDD in Haskell.

Our contributions are:

\begin{itemize}
\item
    Add support for QuickCheck properties to \doctest{}
    (Section \ref{sec:for-users} and Section \ref{sec:doctest})

\item
    Introduce a set of combinators to set of expectations about \emph{code
    examples} for use with \hspec{}.
%% \item Introduced {\tt Hspec} from Ruby community to Haskell community and
%% integrated it with QuickCheck
%% (Section \ref{sec:for-developers} and Section \ref{sec:hspec})
\item Show best current practice of BDD in Haskell using \doctest{} and
    \hspec{} (Section \ref{ref:Best-current-practice})
\end{itemize}

\noindent Our \doctest{} implementation
can be used for design, documentation and automatic testing.
We hope that this kill-three-birds-with-one-stone aspect
motivates Haskellers to write test code.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Terminology}

The definitions of words used in this paper is as follows:

\begin{description}
\item[developer]
    A programmer who develops a library.
\item[user]
    A programmer who uses a library.
%%\item[unit test] tests for individual programs or libraries.
\item[example]
    A typical usage example of a function.
\item[property]
    An invariant of a function.
\item[behavior]
    How does a function behave from a users point of view. Behavior can be
    shown by using both examples and properties.
\item[documentation] Explanation of functions.
\end{description}

The word ``behavior'' is associated with actions.
Since pure functions of Haskell are static,
this word might be improper for Haskell.
However, to avoid to define a new terminology,
we use ``behavior'' in this paper.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Problem}

In the Haskell community, HUnit and QuickCheck are commonly used %% what about SmallCheck?
and the {\tt test-framework} package integrates them.
We can categorize {\tt test-framework} as
a tool for TDD.
Before our work and \hspec{}, there was no widely used BDD tool for Haskell.

BDD tools used in other programming language communities are
mainly based on example tests,
and do not support property tests.
To our experience is, that it is not difficult to find properties for
pure Haskell functions.
So, when we bring BDD tools to
Haskell community, we should integrate them with properties test.

We can categorize examples/properties into two types: for users and
and for developers.
Examples/properties for users are those which are useful as user documentation.
By contrast, examples/properties for developers are
those which are not useful as user documentation.
A good example of examples/properties for developers
is a corner example registered in a bug tracking system.

BDD tools should be treat both of them and provide functionality
to extract examples/properties for users as user documentation.
If we can archive this, BDD tools can be used for
triple purpose: design, documentation and automatic testing.

A good candidate for this is \doctest{} in Python community.
It extends Python's documentation strings so that they
can contain examples.
Examples can be tested by the Python interpreter.

The standard documentation mechanism for Haskell is
Haddock~\cite{haddock}.
Haddock defines markup syntax in Haskell's comment.
Haddock provides markup for code blocks, indicated with ({\tt >}).
For example, the {\tt containers} packages has the following code block markup:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
-- | /O(1)/. Is the map empty?
--
-- > Data.Map.null (empty)           == True
-- > Data.Map.null (singleton 1 'a') == False

null :: Map k a -> Bool
null Tip      = True
null (Bin {}) = False
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}

\noindent Though the code block itself is a useful feature,
we think this kind of usage has problems.
If the equations above are examples, we cannot distinguish
their results from their expression to be evaluated.
If they are properties, they should be distinguished
from example code.

To describe examples/properties for developers, we can use \hspec{}.

Here is a summary of the problem:

\begin{itemize}
\item The Haskell community does not have common syntax to describe
examples/properties with Haddock markup syntax.
\item The Haskell community does not have a BDD tool for examples/properties
    for users.
\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Solution}

To be able to specify examples and properties for users, we propose to add new
markup to Haddock and to use \doctest{} integrated with QuickCheck. To
describe examples/properties for developers, we propose to use \hspec{} also
integrated with QuickCheck.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Examples/properties for users}
\label{sec:for-users}

Examples/properties for users should be documented with Haddock markup syntax.
For this purpose, we propose the followings:

\begin{itemize}
\item Define a new Haddock markup for examples.
\item Define a new Haddock markup for properties.
\item Bring \doctest{} from the Python community to the Haskell
community and integrate it with QuickCheck.
\end{itemize}

First, we introduce a new Haddock markup for the example.
In this paper, we use {\tt >>>} which is the same as Python's one.
Here is an example:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
>>> length []
0
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}

\noindent The first line starts with {\tt >>>} and an expression follows. The second line contains its result. We can write this by copy-and-pasting from an interpreter and modifying the prompt.
It's worth explaining that we can specify operation sequences:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
>>> writeFile "tmpfile" "Hello"
>>> readFile "tmpfile"
"Hello"
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}

\noindent Also, we can show exceptions.

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
>>> head []
*** Exception: Prelude.head: empty list
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}

To specify properties, we also propose a new markup. In this paper, we use the {\tt prop>} prefix. We can write properties which do not take parameters as follows:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
prop> Data.Map.null empty == True
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}

\noindent Of course, we allowed properties which take parameters by
using closed lambda terms.
Type signatures can be specified for each parameter:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
prop> \xs -> sort xs == sort (sort (xs::[Int]))
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}

\noindent Since the right hand side of {\tt ->} is verbose as documentation,
lambda terms without the lambda prefix are also allowed:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
prop> sort xs == sort (sort (xs::[Int]))
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}

Examples and properties in comments are automatically
tested by the \doctest{} command. We also provided a library
to do this job. Its implementation will discussed in Section~\ref{sec:doctest}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Examples/properties for developers}
\label{sec:for-developers}

\begin{quote}
    \emph{TBD: Behavior should be replaced with examples/properties in this subsection?}
\end{quote}

If we have examples/properties that does not fit into the user documentation, but
would rather be part of a design document, we use \hspec{}.

\hspec{} provides an EDSL for defining specs.  A spec organizes behavior in a
tree structure, and it is defined with \texttt{it} and \texttt{describe}.

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
import Test.Hspec.Monadic
spec :: Specs
spec = do
  describe "reverse" $ do
    it "reverses a list" $
      reverse [1 :: Int, 2, 3] @?= [3, 2, 1]

    it "gives the original list, if applied twice" $ property $
      \xs -> reverse (reverse xs) == (xs :: [Int])
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}

\noindent The {\tt it} function combines a text description for a behavior and
a property or an example that gives some confidence in that behavior into a
spec.
Examples can be arbitrary HUnit assertions.  Properties must be of type {\tt
Property}; QuickCheck's \texttt{property} function can be used to turn
arbitrary properties inot a \texttt{Property}.

The \texttt{describe} function combines a list of specs into a larger spec.  It
can be used to organize a spec as a tree.
Internally, a \texttt{Writer} is used to build up specs in a monadic way.

\begin{quote}
    \emph{TBD: provide an example?}
\end{quote}

A spec can be run with the \texttt{hspecX} function.  When a spec is run, all
properties and examples are evaluated, and failing properties and examples are
reported to the user (FIXME: user does not fit our definition of \emph{user}
here!).

\begin{quote}
    \emph{TBD: should user be replaced with developer?}
\end{quote}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Implementation}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Haddock}

As we described, Haddock version 2.7.2 or earlier provides markup syntax for
code blocks, but does not provide any markup syntax for examples or properties.
We implemented markup support for examples ({\tt >>>}) and it is available in
Haddock version 2.8 or later.
We also extended Haddock to support markup for properties ({\tt prop>}) which
will be available with a future release of Haddock.
Both examples and properties in Haddock comments are pretty-printed when
generating documentation, (e.g. as HTML).

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{QuickCheck}

It is enough to test properties which do not have parameters just one.
However, QuickCheck 2.3 or earlier tests 
properties which do not have parameters 100 times.
More precisely, the evaluation results are memorized and they are
compared with {\tt True} 100 times.
The current maintainer of QuickCheck modified so that
properties which do not have parameters
are tested just once in its source repository.
This feature will be available in the future release.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{\doctest}
\label{sec:doctest}

\subsubsection{Testing examples}

TBD(@sol): how to obtain examples and properties from Haddock markup.
Old version uses Haddock API but now uses GHC API directly. Why?

TBD(@sol): escape from HUnit. Why?

TBD(@sol): Old version executes one GHCi for each function examples.
But new version executes one GHCI per module.
Drastic speed up. Do We need a graph for execution time?

Since test is done by comparing result string in Haddock notation
and result string from GHCi, exceptions can be handled.

\subsubsection{Testing properties}

To test properties, we also uses GHCi.
Each property is enclosed with
the ``\verb|quickCheck (|'' and ``\verb|)|'' string
and GHCi evaluates it.
Success or failures is decided according to result string from GHCi.

If properties contain free variables,
we need to add lambda abstraction prefix before prepending
the `quickCheck'' string.
To check if properties contain free variables,
we also use GHCi for easy implementation at this moment.
GHCi reports free variables if found:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
Prelude Data.List> sort xs == sort (sort (xs::[Int]))
<interactive>:1:6: Not in scope: `xs'
<interactive>:1:24: Not in scope: `xs'
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
    \emph{TBD: describe the algorithm}
\end{quote}


\noindent In this case, we should prepend the ``\verb|\xs -> |" string
to the property.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% \subsection{Hspec}
%% \label{sec:hspec}

%% TBD.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Best current practice}
\label{ref:Best-current-practice}

This section show best current practice of
BDD in Haskell.

\begin{quote}
    \emph{TBD: one more example relating to IO is desired.}
\end{quote}

\subsection{Procedure of BDD}

First, we write a signature and leave the definition of the function undefined.

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
rev :: [a] -> [a]
rev = undefined
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}

\noindent Note that the {\tt placeholders} library provide better keyword such as {\tt notImplemented} and {\tt todo}.
Next we write examples/properties for users in Haddock markup:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
-- |
-- 'rev' @xs@ returns the elements of @xs@
-- in reverse order. @xs@ must be finite.
--
-- >>> rev [1,2,3]
-- [3,2,1]
--
-- prop> rev [] == rev []
-- prop> rev (xs ++ ys) == rev ys ++ rev (xs::[Int])
-- prop> rev (rev xs) == (xs::[Int])

rev :: [a] -> [a]
rev = undefined
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}

\noindent We should execute \doctest{} to ensure no syntax errors.
Also, we specifies examples/properties for developers with \hspec{}:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
describe "rev" $ do
  it "returns the first element in the last" $
    property $ \xs -> not (null xs) ==>
      head (rev xs) == last (xs :: [Int])

  it "returns the last element in the first" $
    property $ \xs -> not (null xs) ==>
      last (rev xs) == head (xs :: [Int])
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}

\noindent Also, we should execute this \hspec{} module
to ensure no syntax errors.
Then we implement the function.

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
rev :: [a] -> [a]
rev = foldl (flip (:)) []
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}

\noindent Now we run test suites until
all test failures disappear.

Note that the authors are not fundamentalist.
If functions to be defined are simple enough,
we might implement them first withtout signatures.
And their signatures can be automatically
inserted by IDE (such as Emacs/vim with {\tt ghc-mod}) later
if Haskell compilers can infer correctly.
Also, we can copy-and-paste examples and their results
from Haskell interpreters to their Haddock markup.

\subsection{Combining multiple specs}

\begin{quote}
    \emph{should emphasize ``automatically discover tests''}
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
    \emph{talk about CI}
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
\emph{This is optional, so we can skip it, if necessary.}
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
\emph{How about moving this to appendix?}
\end{quote}

\begin{itemize}
\item We create a spec file for each source file
\item By convention, spec files end in Spec.hs
\end{itemize}

\noindent If we have a source tree like so:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
src/Foo.hs
src/Foo/Bar.hs
src/Baz.hs
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}

\noindent We would end up with the following spec files.

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
test/FooSpec.hs
test/Foo/BarSpec.hs
test/BazSpec.hs
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}

\begin{itemize}
\item We still want to combine those specs into a single spec.
\item By convention we put the combined spec into test/Spec.hs
\end{itemize}

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
import Test.Hspec.Monadic

import qualified FooSpec
import qualified Foo.BarSpec
import qualified BazSpec

main :: IO ()
main = hspecX $ do
  describe "Foo"     FooSpec.spec
  describe "Foo.Bar" Foo.BarSpec.spec
  describe "Baz"     BazSpec.spec
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}

\begin{itemize}
\item We use a preprocessor (http://hackage.haskell.org/package/hspec-discover) to automatically generate this boilerplate.
\end{itemize}

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
{-# OPTIONS_GHC -F -pgmF hspec-discover #-}
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Integrating multiple test suites}

\begin{itemize}

\item @kazu: Can you add a reference to:
\url{http://www.haskell.org/cabal/users-guide/developing-packages.html#test-suites}

\item It is important that testing is automated, including running of test
    suites.  Where should we put this?
\end{itemize}

\noindent Cabals test feature can be used to automatically run tests.  A cabal
file can contain multiple test suites, so it is possible to define test suites
for \doctest{} and \hspec{} in a single cabal file.

A driver for \hspec{} looks like so:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
-- file Spec.hs
import Test.Hspec.Monadic
main = hspecX spec
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}

\noindent And a corresponding Cabal test suite section like so:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
test-suite spec
  type:          exitcode-stdio-1.0
  main-is:       Spec.hs
  build-depends: base, hspec
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}

\noindent A driver for \doctest{} looks like so:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
-- file doctests.hs
import Test.DocTest
main = doctest ["src/Main.hs"]
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}

\noindent And a corresponding Cabal test suite section like so:

\begin{quote}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
test-suite doctests
  type:          exitcode-stdio-1.0
  main-is:       doctests.hs
  build-depends: base, doctest
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}
