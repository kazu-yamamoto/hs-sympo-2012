\section{Introduction}

%%%% Describe the problem.

TBD: Strong type system.

TBD: Tend not to write tests

The purpose of this paper is to
encourage Haskllers to write documentation, which can be used for testing, in their libraries.

%%%% State your contributions.

The contribution of this paper is as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item Introduced {\tt doctest} from Python community to Haskell community
and integrated it with QuickCheck (Section XXX)
\item Introduced {\tt hspec} from Ruby community to Haskell community and
integrated it with QuickCheck (Section XXX)
\item Show best current practice of design/documentation/tests (Section XXX)
\end{itemize}

\section{Terminology}

\begin{description}
\item[unit test] TBD
\item[example] TBD
\item[property] TBD
\item[behavior] TBD
\item[documentation] Text written in Haskell comments and parsed by Haddock
\end{description}

\section{Observation}

Haddock example and doctest.

Should talk about equation property. (e.g. container)
Quickcheck.

pure vs IO.

\section{Solution}

FIRST convey the idea.

\subsection{Tests suitable with doctest}

\subsection{Tests suitable with hspec}

\subsection{Integrating multiple test suites}

\section{Best current practice}

undefined.

The authors are not fundamentalist.
If functions to be defined are simple enough,
we might implement them first withtout signatures.
And their signatures can be automatically
inserted by IDE (like ghc-mod) later
if Haskell compilers can infer correctly.
Also, we can cut and paste typical examples and their results
from Haskell interpreters to their document.

\section{Implementation}

\subsection{doctest}

\subsection{doctest and QuickCheck}

\subsection{hspec}

\section{Related work}

literate programming.

hunit.

test-framework.

smallCheck.

And others?

\acks

We would like to thank
Nick Smallbone for having improved QuickCheck so that boolean property is tested
just once.
We are grateful to David Waern and Simon Marlow
for introducing the property syntax to haddock.
